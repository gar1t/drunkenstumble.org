======

I'm Garrett Smith and this is my blog. I'm a programmer at
[CloudBees](http://www.cloudbees.com/). I'm interested in how humans solve
problems, either intentionally or inadvertently. I tend to use a lot of
[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) in my work and personal projects because it's
a fantastic general purpose tools. To get things to talk to one another, I like
[0MQ](http://www.zeromq.org).

I enjoy poking fun at [things that bother me](/blog/category/videos/).

To keep up to date on vides, blog posts and other work,
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/gar1t) is the best option at the moment. I try
hard to avoid trivialities in the stream and provide quality content!
